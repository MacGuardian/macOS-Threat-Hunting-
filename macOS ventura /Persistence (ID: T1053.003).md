"Adversaries may abuse the cron utility to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code.[1] The cron utility is a time-based job scheduler for Unix-like operating systems. The crontab file contains the schedule of cron entries to be run and the specified times for execution. Any crontab files are stored in operating system-specific file paths.

An adversary may use cron in Linux or Unix environments to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for Persistence."
